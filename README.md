# Project Title
Global Superstore Sales Performance Analysis and Visualization Dashboard


## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive and interactive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard to analyze the historical sales and profitability of the Global Superstore.
The dashboard aims to provide key stakeholders, such as Sales Managers and Executives, with actionable insights to monitor performance, identify growth opportunities, and optimize operational and 
sales strategies on a global scale.The dataset was first cleaned and pre-processed in Microsoft Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency before building the interactive dashboard in Power BI.

## Data Source
The project utilizes the Global Superstore sales dataset, which contains detailed transaction records including sales figures, profit margins, product categories and sub-categories, customer details, shipping logistics, and geographical data spanning multiple years. This rich dataset provides a comprehensive view of sales and operations, making it suitable for analyzing performance, profitability, and business trends at a global scale.
